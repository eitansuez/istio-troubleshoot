# Control plane Health

## TODO

- istiod logs
- istioctl admin log
- are there errors in the logs?
- metrics:
    - pilot error rate
    - istio validation error rate
    - sidecar injection error rate
- monitor the control plane - specific metrics to look for
    - the istio control plane grafana dashboard

- what governs how much work istio has to do?
    - number of running workloads / services
    - frequency of deployment changes (adding, removing, updating)
    - frequency of mesh configuration changes
    - service discoverability scope (use sidecar resources)
